@pigi/core documentation
========================
Hello and welcome to the documentation for Plasma Group's ``@pigi/core``!
``@pigi/core`` is the set of core modules that our other plasma chain clients use.

**A quick note:** ``@pigi/core`` is **not** our ``Node.js`` client, ``@pigi/client``.
Documentation for ``@pigi/client`` is available at the `@pigi/client docs`_.
