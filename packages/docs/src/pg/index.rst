Welcome to Plasma Group
=======================
Hello and welcome to Plasma Group!
We're building free and open software to scale blockchains right now.
Right now we're mainly focused on building an easy to use general purpose plasma chain.

Just like any big software endeavor, the Plasma Group ecosystem is composed of a lot of moving parts.
In an effort to keep this ecosystem maintainable, we're documenting as much as we possibly can.
A lot of our documentation is about Plasma Group projects, but there's also a lot about plasma, layer 2, and blockchains in general.
